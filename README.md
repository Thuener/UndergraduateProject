UndergraduateProject
====================

Subjective analysis of text content applied to the Portuguese language

This is my Final Project for Undergraduate at PUC-Rio with my advisor Prof. Raúl Rentería.
This project deals with the problem of classification of Subjectivity in Portuguese textual content, also known as Sentiment Analysis, using machine learning techniques. We present some theory aspects used in the subject and also the tools used in the experiments. In the project, a considerable amount of effort was used to generate tests to confirm some theories presented in the use of sentiment Analyses using SVM (Support Vectors Machine), a machine learning technique.

More information with the presentation and the report from this work can be found in  http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~tsilva/?page_id=143#project1.
